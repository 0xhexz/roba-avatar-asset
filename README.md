# ROBA Avatar Visual Asset

This repository contains a square avatar image designed to represent the ROBA ethos—open collaboration, reproducibility, modular development, and futuristic tooling.

## Contents
- `src/avatar.svg` — Vector source (embedded PNG fallback)
- `exports/avatar.png` — High-resolution 1024×1024 PNG

## Design Rationale
The avatar uses a strong geometric "R" motif with a cyan-magenta gradient and subtle grid background to convey modernity, developer tooling, and modular composition. The square format and high-resolution exports make it suitable for marketplace listing and identity use.

## How to reuse / reproduce
- Open `src/avatar.svg` in Figma, Illustrator, or Photopea.
- Edit colors or shapes as needed.
- Export PNG/WebP at desired sizes.
- For pixel-perfect edits, open the embedded PNG or replace with a native vector design.
